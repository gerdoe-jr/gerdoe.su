## Zaddof-Chu Sequence

### Date: 24.11.2025

### Definition

A Zadoff‑Chu sequence is defined by two key parameters:

- A **root index** $q = 1,2,\dots,N_{zc}-1$
- A **sequence length** $N_{zc}$, which is required to be an odd number (and in many treatments is taken to be prime).

Given those, the $q$‑th ZC sequence $s_q[n]$ of length $N_{zc}$ is given by

$$
s_q[n] = \exp\!\left(-j \pi \, \frac{q\, n (n+1)}{N_{zc}}\right), \quad n = 0,1,2,\dots, N_{zc}-1
$$

---

### Key Properties

#### Constant amplitude

Because $s_q[n]$ is of the form $\exp(\cdot)$, all values of $s_q[n]$ have magnitude $1$. Thus the amplitude is constant, and only the phase changes from sample to sample.

This property implies that the peak‑to‑average power ratio of the resulting signal is unity (minimal).

#### Zero cyclic autocorrelation (under ideal conditions)

For sequences of length $N_{zc}$ satisfying the conditions (especially when $N_{zc}$ is prime), the cyclic (periodic) autocorrelation of $s_q[n]$ is zero for all non‑zero cyclic shifts:

$$
R_{s_q s_q}[\tau] = \sum_{n=0}^{N_{zc}-1} s_q^*[n] \, s_q[(n+\tau)\bmod N_{zc}] = 0, \quad \forall \tau \ne 0
$$

And the normalized cyclic autocorrelation is

$$
\bar R_{s_q s_q}[\tau] = \frac{1}{N_{zc}} R_{s_q s_q}[\tau]
$$

so that $\bar R_{s_q s_q}[0] = 1$ and $\bar R_{s_q s_q}[\tau \neq 0] = 0$.

Because of the constant amplitude and this perfect autocorrelation behavior, ZC sequences are part of the class **CAZAC** (Constant Amplitude Zero AutoCorrelation) sequences.

#### Fixed cyclic cross‑correlation (under ideal conditions)

For any two distinct ZC sequences of the same length $N_{zc}$, with root indices $q_1 \neq q_2$, and under the condition that $|q_1 - q_2|$ is relatively prime to $N_{zc}$, the normalized cyclic cross‑correlation is

$$
\bar R_{s_{q_1} s_{q_2}}[\tau] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{zc}}}, \quad \forall \tau
$$

The un‑normalized cross‑correlation magnitude is therefore $\sqrt{N_{zc}}$. This is optimal given the zero‑autocorrelation property.

#### DFT-IDFT invariance

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or inverse DFT (IDFT) of a ZC sequence is also a ZC sequence (or closely related). This enables implementation in the frequency domain for OFDMA/SC‑FDMA waveforms.

### Practical considerations and caveats

Perfect properties strictly hold when $N_{zc}$ is prime and $|q_1 - q_2|$ is relatively prime to $N_{zc}$.
In real systems, sequence length $N_{sf}$ may not be prime. ZC‑like sequences can be generated by **cyclic extension** or **truncation**:

- **Cyclic extension**: $z_q[n] = s_q[n \bmod N_{zc}]$ for $n = 0,1,\dots,N_{sf}-1$
- **Truncation**: Discard the last $N_{zc}-N_{sf}$ samples of a prime-length ZC sequence

The resulting sequences may not strictly satisfy the zero‑autocorrelation and fixed cross‑correlation properties. Practical impairments such as fractional timing shifts, frequency offsets, noise, or multipath can degrade ideal properties.

### Summary

A Zadoff‑Chu sequence is a complex unit‑amplitude sequence parameterized by a root index and sequence length, defined as

$$
s_q[n] = \exp\!\left(-j \pi \frac{q\,n(n+1)}{N_{zc}}\right), \quad n = 0,1,\dots,N_{zc}-1
$$

Key virtues (under ideal length and root conditions) include:

- Constant amplitude
- Zero cyclic autocorrelation for non-zero shifts
- Fixed cyclic cross-correlation between distinct roots
- DFT/IDFT invariance
